# soybean_traits-VIs_ML
In this project we investigated the ability of multispectral imaging-derived vegetation indices (VIs) and agronomic traits to predict soybean plot yield. The project utilizes machine learning techniques in scikit-learn, python to build accurate yield prediction models on the basis of linear regression, decision tree, random forest and xgboost.
